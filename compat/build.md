# Build NovaPhy

[TOC]

## Build on Windows with MSVC

TODO

## Build With GCC/Clang

### Basic

NovaPhy without IPC support only requires the following prerequisites (as mentioned in [README.md](../README.md#setup)):

- [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/) (Miniconda or Anaconda)
- [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/) installed. *Optional*
- C++20 compiler
  - MSVC 2019+
  - GCC 11+
  - Clang 14+

```bash
# Create conda environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate novaphy

# Install NovaPhy
CMAKE_ARGS="--preset=default" pip install -e .

# Then you can access NovaPhy from Python in the virtual environment.
python
```

### IPC support

NovaPhy relies on [libuipc](https://github.com/spiriMirror/libuipc) for IPC support.
It requires C++20 features, and some of its upstream dependencies rely on non-standard features.
Thus, the prerequisites are more specific.

- [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/) (Miniconda or Anaconda)
- [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io/) installed.
- C++20 compiler
  - MSVC 2019+
  - GCC 11, 12, 13
  - Clang 19+
- CUDA 12.4

```bash
conda activate novaphy

# Before this step, make sure your environment variables are set (for example, VCPKG_ROOT).
git submodule update --init --recursive # Update submodules.
CMAKE_ARGS="--preset=ipc" pip install -e .
```

### Troubleshooting

If you use a compiler not listed above, the default configuration may fail.
Here are some common causes of failures with specific compilers:

| Compiler | Reason | Status |
|:---:|:---|:---:|
| `gcc-9` | **libuipc** needs `<span>`, which was introduced in GCC 10. | Unfixable |
| `gcc-10` | The PSTL in `libstdc++ 10` isn't compatible with `onetbb` in the current baseline. (See also [vcpkg.json](../vcpkg.json).) | Unfixable |
| `gcc-15` | `urdfdom` expects a non-standard import for `uint32_t`, which has been removed from `libstdc++`. | Fixed [^1] |
| `gcc-14, gcc-15` | `gcc>13` is not compatible with `nvcc-12` | Unfixable |
| `clang-14` | Instantiate a member function with the constraint that is trivial and false. | TODO |
| `clang <=18` | `libuipc` uses alias template deduction which isn't support by erlay `clang`. | Unfixable [^2] |
| `clang 19` | `libstdc++ 12` isn't completely compatible with `clang19` | Unfixable |
| `nvcc-13` | **muda** expects non-strict dependent name resolution. | TODO |

[^1]: The issue has been fixed by upstream maintainers with a patch. However, the patch has not been included in the current baseline (2025.07.25). Adding `-include cstdint` to your `CXXFLAGS` environment variable should resolve the problem.
[^2]: But these features are just needed by CUDA targets. If you have another compiler to be used as CUDA host compiler (e.g. gcc 11), clang14+ could compile the project as compiler of C/C++ targets.

> [!note] Clang with libstdc++
> Clang uses `libstdc++` as the default standard library. Any crash caused by `libstdc++` also affects Clang.

Compilers are described by name and major version, such as `gcc-9`. For each major version, only one version is tested (✅ marks compatible compilers, or combinations):

- GCC 9.5.0
- GCC 10.5.0
- ✅ GCC 11.5.0
- ✅ GCC 12.5.0
- ✅ GCC 13.4.0
- GCC 14.3.0
- GCC 15.2.1
- Clang 18 and below.
- ✅ Clang 19.1.7 with `libstdc++ 13`
- ✅ nvcc-12: CUDA compilation tools, release 12.4, V12.4.131
- nvcc-13: CUDA compilation tools, release 13.1, V13.1.115

Here are problems about library conflict:

- `CUDA12` has conflict implementation of some math function to `glibc 2.43` which added `noexcept` to math functions. It will break compiling with strict `noexcept` checking compiler (almost all version of Clang).

## Build and Package

### Package with Python build tools

Using `build` with `scikit-build-core` will build and package the two components of NovaPhy together into a wheel package. This is convenient for Python developers.

```bash
pip install build
CMAKE_ARGS="--preset=ipc" python -m build
```

### Standalone CMake

To use NovaPhy in a C++ program, you can build it as a standard CMake project. You can install NovaPhy on your machine using CMake (as shown below), or use `add_subdirectory(/path/to/NovaPhy)` directly.

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -S .. -B . --preset=default --install-prefix=/path/to/installation
# or
cmake -S .. -B . --preset=ipc ... # to enable ipc support

# build
cmake --build .

# install
cmake --install . --component core
```
